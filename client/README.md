### Website Concept: 
Our website is a NBA fantasy team Manager!
The app is way to get current stats on active NBA players, edit, delete and review flashcards for studying.

### Process:  

What challenges did you encounter?
  * The challenges arose from the modulization of various components and containers. As redux allows the state to be updated continously. The challenges were getting the proper name identification for each state. As sometimes they would return an array and sometimes an object. 

What were your successes?
  * With the power of redux we were able to naviagte the state smoothly and even without hitting the backend for data.

### What were the technologies used? 
  * MongoDb
  * Heroku for the domain
  * Mlab MySql
  * HTML
  * JavaScript
  * React
  * Semantic UI CSS
  * Redux

### Home Page
  * This will load a starting page that contains a navbar and a desciption of the features of the app 
  * The nav bar contains 2 different layouts depending if the user is logged in or not.
  * If the user is not logged in they only have access to the homepage, sign up and sign in page.
  * If the user is logged in they have access to the view user team page and create team page.

### Add a Player to Your Current Team Feature
  * This page allows users to view all active players in the NBA in a table format. 
  * This page also contains a team loading box that will hold the users player selection. 
  * The table contains 4 columns which are Name, Position, Fantasy Points and Add Player to team.
  * The Name and Position columns are sortable and searchable so a user can filter the data. Fantasy points is also sortable and can be combined with position to obtain the most fantasy points by position.
